1. setup Python environment on your IDE. Eclipse was used for this assignment.
2. 3 files are needed to run the code: Main_Solution.py, Sort_test.py, TimingCode.py
3. Main_Solution.py contains the sorting algorithms and the Select algorithm to find the kth smallest number
4. Sort_test.py contains the unit tests. This file compares the kth smallest obtained from the Select Algo with the kth smallest obtained
   after sorting the array by Insertion sort, quicksort and built in sort function.
   On this file,  right click -> run-as -> Python unit-test
   This file will request for value for 'k' from the user.
5. TimingCode.py Run right click ->run-as -> Python run. This file will ask value for 'k' from the user.
