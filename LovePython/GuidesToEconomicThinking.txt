Should recall that the primary purpose of this course is to help you understand the economic way of thinking to this end let's consider some helpful guides some of these guides economic thinking we've encountered before so I will simply mention them without further explanation first test the theory by its predictions remember the secondary or indirect effects they are important do not overlook the third scarcity is pervasive and scarcity implies costs we live in a world in which we are forced to make trade-offs fourth people are willing to make trade-offs so the previous guide said that we are forced to make trade-offs and this one says that we are willing to make trade-offs as an example think about the value of life it is common to talk as though human life is sacred and that we should do anything to protect and preserve it but is that how we actually behave when we live longer if we ate better and grow slower a fifth guide to economic thinking is the concept of revealed preference and this is the idea that decision-makers should be judged by what they do rather than by what would they say and we just on example of this regarding the value of life a six guides economic thinking and one that we have implicitly assumed up to this point is the principle of self-interest that individuals act in their own self-interest in other words incentives matter what this means is that decision-makers compare the costs and benefits of their actions if the benefits are greater the costs you will do the action if the benefits are less than the cost you want to the action the next guide economic thinking is decisions are made at the margin what this means is that if a decision-maker optimizes they will perform an action as long as the additional benefits outweigh the additional costs they might note that this guide thinking is highlighted in red and this is because this is a very important guide to thinking in fact it is one that it makes up the essence of this course and one that we will return to time and time again in the later stages of this course the final guide economic thinking is that information is scarce like any other good we don't have as much of it as we would like and therefore we are forced to make decisions under uncertainty
