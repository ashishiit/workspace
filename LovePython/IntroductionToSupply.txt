Can I study the concept of supply in the process you should notice a lot of similarities with our coverage of demand consider two types of supply first there's the supply by a particular person or firm and the definition of this type of supply is it is a schedule of prices and quantities showing the maximum quantity the seller is willing and able to offer for sale at each of these prices given this definition the following will all be the same supply supply curve and supply schedule they are interchangeable for economists supply is the supply curve or supply schedule so this means that supply does not refer to a specific quantity it is not a particular amount here we have two representations of the supply by an individual seller one is in the form of the table we have a column prices in a column of quantities this is the supply schedule the other is in the form of a graph for measuring quantity on the horizontal axis and the price on the vertical axis in both instances we are relating various prices with the various quantities okay so supply is not a particular quantity say 20 or 30 units but instead it's the entire range or schedule of prices and quantities so what kind of relationship is this between the price and the quantity will the answer is this a positive or direct relationship as one increases the other increases they move in the same direction the higher the price the more the seller wishes to sell and this is such a universal relationship that it is referred to as the laws apply quite simply the law supply says the higher the price the more the seller is willing to sell now let's consider a second kind of supply suppose that you have a number sellers all of whom wish to sell a particular good can we somehow aggregate their individual supply curves to create a collective supply for the good well yes we can in this call market supply and the formal definition of market supply is a schedule of prices and quantities showing the maximum quantity sellers are willing and able to offer for sale at each of these prices you'll notice that this definition definition is very similar to the one for the individual supply except that this one considers sellers rather than the seller and the way in which we would derive a market supply curve is the process known as horizontal summation here we have two individuals Brown and Alberts each with their own supply curve along with other sellers that have their own supply curve and it is you can see that stay at a price of $11 Brown would like to sell two units Alberts would like to sell three units other sellers in the market would like to sell 98 units and so that gives us a price of $11 a total market quantity of 103 units 2+3+90 8F we then change the price of $12 Brown wishes to sell three units Albert wishes to sell four units other sellers wish to sell hundred and two units so at $12 all the sellers in the market together would like to sell hundred and nine units 3+402 to notice what were doing were calling out a price were going to eat seller finding out how much they would wish to offer Purcell and then were adding up those quantities at that price and that gives us one point on the market supply curve we then repeat the process with a different price and that gives us a second point on the market supply curve and by repeatedly doing this we can map out them the market supply curve and because quantity is measured on the horizontal axis this is called horizontal summation we call out a price and we we add up the quantities which are measured on the horizontal axis here we have the same process only illustrated with a table again you can see a column of prices you have a column of quantities offered for sale by Brown a column of quantities offered by set for sale by Alberts and then all other sellers and so for each price we just simply add up the quantities and that gives us a total market quantity at that price we then repeat that with different prices and in the process we derive a column of quantities for the market along with the quantity or column of the prices for the market and we plot these two columns we get the market supply curve now let's consider the determinants of the amount offered for sale specifically we're going to consider the factors that will affect the quantity of good acts sellers are willing and able to offer for sale and so I'm simply get a list a number of these factors as we go through them if you don't understand him that's fine don't worry about it because we will come back and talk about each one in turn no one factor that we've already talked about is the price of good acts another factor will be the number sellers a third factor will be the price of inputs or resources used to produce the good fourth factor will be the technology in the production process another factor will be the price of goods related in production and again will talk about what we mean by this a little bit later on yet another factor will be the price expectations by sellers and finally we will look at taxes or subsidies imposed on sellers now recall that we as previously defined supply K so supply is the relationship between what to variables well supply is the relationship between the two variables highlighted in red so specifically it is the relationship between the quantity of good acts sellers and are willing and able to offer for sale as we measured on on the horizontal axis versus the price of good acts which were measuring on the vertical axis were not quite done supply is a relationship between quantity and price citrus parables now remember what setters Purvis means it means all other factors constant so specifically what are we holding constant will the answer is we look at the relationship between quantity and price for given supply relationship for holding constant would be all of these other factors so the number sellers price of inputs technology and so on all of these factors are held constant we draw particular supply curve only two things are allowed to change the quantity and the price so given what we've just said how will the change in price affect supply now think about this very carefully well the answer is price never ever affect supply line how can we say that will the answer is supply refers to the supply curve is supply schedule and a change in price will not cause the curve with the schedule to change or shift a change in price will simply cause a movement along the given supply curve to take this particular supply curve here suppose we have a price of a certain amount and that gives us a certain appoint on the supply curve and now we increase the price to say here that will move us to another point on the same curve so the curve itself does not change but now you may be thinking doesn't the law supply tell us of the price of a good will affect how much sellers want to sell yes this is true but the amount that sellers want to sell is not what we mean by supply we have another term for the specific quantity that says wish to sell and we call this quantity supplied abbreviated QS this is the specific quantity that sellers wish to sell it is what we are measuring along the horizontal axis so for given supply curve what will cause a change in quantity supplied with the answer is a change in price specifically if the price increases quantity supplied will increase while at the price decreases the quantity supplied will decrease by the way this relationship right here is just a shorthand way of saying the law of supply
