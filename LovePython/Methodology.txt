Let's begin by taking a look at methodology by methodology we mean the techniques procedures or methods one uses to discover knowledge and think about it you should realize that different disciplines you utilize different methodologies for example take chemistry versus history to discover new knowledge is stored in my talk to the participants of a historical event or reader correspondence to look at official documents on a chemist on the other hand might perform a laboratory experiment economics assignments so let's take a look at the methodology of science what is it that scientists are well the two major features of the scientific approach first is to collect facts and the second is the use of the theory consumed the first step collecting facts so exactly what is in fact let me define it as a measurable event or observation for instance the following examples the air temperature or pressure around you right now the average number of people in US household the number of US to traffic counties last year women tend to live longer than men tides versus low tides now and I believe you heard that you for the phrase that the facts speak for themselves in other words the reason for back or set of facts is so obvious that we need not seriously examine well let me send facts do not speak for themselves they must be interpreted or explained this by the way is particularly true in economics because many popular perceptions regarding his obviously true fall apart under examination we've just seen that the facts must be interpreted or explained so now let's turn to the second characteristic of the scientific approach and that is the use of the theory theory is a testable explanation of facts and this naturally brings up the question of how you go about testing a theory well there to approaches but let me focus on just one of them right now the theory is tested on the basis of its predictions or implications these predictions are logically implied by the theory and they are about the real world and therefore they are intentionally refutable that is a theory must be falsifiable so the process of testing a theory is to first generate as many predictions as you can if this there is correct we should observe in a the same concern about the real world and then compare these predictions to the real world itself so compared predictions of the theory to the real world how do we distinguish a good theory from a bad theory well the good theory is one whose predictions repel that is their consistent with the real world of on the other hand is one predictions are not upheld that is they are not consistent with the real world so you can replace a BNC but you don't in fact observed a BNC in the real world let's consider an example of facts in the theory for instance the tides if you go down to the seashore the wee times when the tide comes in your high time and time for the tide to go out and you have low tide causes this well one possible explanation is to see when can help to get up out of bed the tide comes in we have had Todd when goes back to bed the tide goes out and we have low tide is necessary when the answer is no because we can observe connecting going to bed and getting out of's let's consider an alternative explanation and this is the one about the gravitational attraction of the men let's put in by assuming that the closer to bodies are the stronger the gravitational attraction you have a picture of the earth and the men I theory implies that the gravitational truth attraction of the men will be stronger on one side of the earth compared to another here we have an exaggerated drawing of the title bulge in fact there will be titled bulge or high tide on both sides of the earth balls Marist the man is due to the moon calling the ocean away from your father bulge away from the moon is caused by the earth being pulled away from the ocean not that the areas on the top and the bottom are experiencing low tide so is this a theory that is does it make testable predictions about the real world the answer is a definite yes this theory makes thousands of predictions all around the world every day and because these predictions are consistently upheld the gravitational attraction of the theory for the tides is the commonly accepted theory please note however that this theory is not been proven in fact you can never prove a theory although you can just so and creating and testing a theory let's look at the role of assumptions so the process of testing a theory begins with a collection of prior statements or assumptions in these former theory you will use logic to derive the predictions as many as possible of your theory the final step is to compare these predictions to the real world so far we talk about testing theory by comparing its predictions to the real world but there is another school of thought in this approach says to judge a theory by the realism of its assumptions in particular a good theory is said to have realistic assumptions about that. Has unrealistic assumptions to violate this let's ask ourselves why we use a model or through the real world rather than the real world itself well the purpose is to simplify and by simplifying the model necessarily becomes descriptively unrealistic as an analogy think of a of roadmap is a model the real world but do we really want this roadmap to topically describe the real world or would we rather leave out a lot of unnecessary details for a list take a look at a critical concept to examine the relationship between variables and this is set asparagus and it means everything else the same or holding all other factors constant so what's the purpose is set asparagus well by holding all other relevant factors constant you're able to focus on the variables under study
