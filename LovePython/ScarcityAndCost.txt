This PowerPoint video will take a look at two fundamental concepts in economics scarcity and cost we will begin with two fundamental economic facts first society is unlimited wants and this is because each individual has unlimited wants in other words more is better the society which is the collection of all individuals has unlimited wants secondly resources are limited resources are also known as inputs or factors of production quite simply resources are those things that are used to produce goods and services the two fundamental economic facts implies that goods and services are scarce now scarcity means that not everyone can have all that they want so if a good is scarce then it means that it is desirable and limited so how come the scarcity is that something you can only find if you look really hard with the answers now scarcity is extremely common so common that it is pervasive and this is why the implications of scarcity are so important first scarcity implies competition since not everyone can have all that they want they will compete to get what's available consequently some device or mechanism must be created to allocate the scarce good or service so what are some common rational devices we could ration according to violence the biggest amine is the toughest they can we could ration the goods by queuing up by waiting in line or we could ration goods by using prices secondly scarcity implies that you must choose among alternatives there couple of colloquial expressions that capture the essence of this idea you can't have your cake and eat it too is no such thing as a free lunch in other words life is filled with trade-offs now let's turn to fundamental concept employed by the existence of scarcity and that concept is cost also meaning opportunity cost so what is it let me define opportunity cost is simply the highest valued forgone alternative in other words what's the cost of action I the answer is of all the other actions that you could've chosen but were not unable to because you selected a it is the one that you value the most for quite simply cost as a foregone benefit so let's take a look at a couple of examples of cost first example suppose it is only two goods X and Y was the cost of producing more good acts well the answer is it would be the forgone amount of good why good why must be the highest valued forgone alternative to producing the next because it is the only alternative in a similar manner the cost of producing good why would be the forgone good acts I said example suppose that we produce a good using input and is used to produce goods the end of the following assumptions goods he requires only input a requires no other inputs secondly input has no other uses it can be used to produce good WR Y it's only used produce good see under these conditions what is the cost of producing good see what the answer is the cost is zero there is no cost because you do not forgo any other output so this leads to a fundamental conclusion about cost and that is the cost of producing an output is alternately measured in terms of other outputs please remember this we will be using this later so let's take a look at some conclusions for the concept of cost first cost refers to an action not a thing they do not have costs only actions have costs that conclusion is cost and price are different concepts prices the rate of exchange goods may have costs and you not have prices will talk more about this later thirdly you measure cost in terms of output not in terms of inputs fourth cost does not mean out-of-pocket expenditure means what you forgo or give up final conclusion for cost is why is it that were using this concept of cost well the reason is because of its ability to predict behavior there's a fundamental approach in economics that says that decision-makers compare costs and benefits of their actions until it's this cost that when changes will affect the willingness of decision-makers to engage in particular behavior final topic that I want to address at this point is uncertainty and cost and that is expected cost so what if an action has a cost which you may or may not for example you exceed the speed limit where you illegally parked you know that you make it parking ticket for speeding ticket or you may not in this case what's relevant is the expected cost and the expected cost is simply the cost times the probability of incurring the cost so how can expected cost change well it is the cost changes on the probability of incurring the cost will check
