It's indeed difficult to analyze people.
Everything depends on one's situation.

I sense that you are a genuine person.
If you are being with some one, spending time with
some one then you are doing it genuinely.

Considering that you and Oi are very good friends.
More than that you considered her as a sister.
All your feeling for her were genuine. If something is
wrong with you or her, either of you will
start feeling it implicitly if feelings are genuine.

Even you and Div started as friends. More than that
you started loving him. When you told me that you were
about to get married, then I thought, WOW. There is
a huge difference between only falling in love and
then committing to it by marriage. I believe that
you must have thought/day dreamed of Div to a perfect
permanent room mate based on some rationale.

Friendship/relationship/love is not only about
trivial issues like talking soft,
being polite, caring about very small things, having fun.
All these things are default and common
and happens with everyone.

The real test is when we feel like someone got our back.
Such chemistry goes a long way.


From your talks, I get vibes like, you are bff
or love someone to get married types. :-)

We all are naive. We love every other person equally.
We feel that if we'll be sweet then we'll receive
sweetness in return. And thus get carried away.
We don't know who is using us.

We simply learn it from experience.

You don't get discouraged. I understnad you had
or may be still have deep inside lot of faith in
Oi and Div. Stick to that faith. Don't retaliate.

I never asked you what you wanted/desired because
I never had a moment with you. But I feel that
you want to do something for Sonita. Something for
parents. Don't get too selfish. Encourage yourself
by thinking about them. I assume, I may be wrong
that you feel guilty that you caused trouble to parents
regarding previous two relationships. Mom/Dad are
looking into that case or may be you'll find someone
down the road. You only need to learn your lesson
from previous mistakes. Mistake can happen once, twice
but not thrice.
