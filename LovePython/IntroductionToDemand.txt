Now it's time to come to the demand for this presentation will we will continue to talk to first of all demand by particular individual and the definition of this kind demand is it is a schedule of prices and quantities showing the maximum quantity the buyers willing to purchase at each price now given this definition notice that the following all mean to say demand demand curve and demand schedule they are interchangeable for Communists and for us demand is the demand curve or demand schedule so particular demand does not refer to a specific amount simply regret the demand would look something like this so how would you describe the relationship between the price and quantity well as I think you can see it is negative in verse and this negative or inverse relationship is called the law of demand what it says is the higher the price the less the buyer wishes to purchase a second kind of demand is what we call market demand and this is quite simply a schedule of prices and quantities showing the maximum quantity buyers are willing to purchase each price and you might notice that this definition differs from the previous definition into this one looks at a number of buyers now the process by which we would construct a market demand curve is called horizontal summation it would have a graphical derivation of the market demand so we have Jones Smith and other buyers and together they will construct the market demand so for example take the price of $12 we see the $12 Jones is right here he wishes to purchase for you Smith at $12 would be right here he would wishes to buy five units and if we look at other buyers and $12 the right here and there demand curve they wish to buy 100 units so $12 the total market wishes to buy for +5+ hundred in other words hundred nine units and so that gives us a single point on the market demand curve to derive a second point such as before here we would simply call out a different price of $11 to each of the individuals Jones Smith and the other buyers we would find out how much each individual wants Jones Smith the other buyers at the and that would give us a total market quantity at that price and that would then give us a second point on the market demand now let's consider the determinants of conception specifically we're going to consider the factors that will affect the quantity of the next buyers are willing and able to purchase a new notice that I've highlighted that in red and I'm simply going to list each factor if you don't understand each one don't worry about it will come back and talk about each one in turn to the first variable will be when we party discussed the price of good X the next factor will be the tastes or preferences for good X next we will look at the number of buyers for good X yet another factor will be the price of substitutes for good X and the price of compliments for good X again will talk about what we mean by substitutes and complement a little bit later on now the income of buyers will be important as well the price expectations by buyers and finally we also can consider the effects of taxes or subsidies imposed on buyers now if you'll recall our previous definition of demand they it will be the quantity of good X buyers willing to purchase versus the price so from the above list demand is the relationship between what to variables to help set to this let's reconsider this information in your notice that we've highlighted two variables here and read the quantity of good X buyers are willing and able to purchase versus the price and so this is our demand relationship were not quite done sector asparagus that you should recall that Seth was of us here means everything else constant to the question is what are we learning constant when we look at the relationship between the quantity of good X buyers willing to purchase and the price of good X will ensure is all of these other factors that we've listed here they will all be how constant we do a particular demand so with this in mind how a change in price effect demand think very very carefully about this and you'll notice that the bottom I have drawn a graph to illustrate the change in price so how is demand been affected with the answer is it hasn't been price never ever affects demand why is that well demand refers to the demand curve or demand schedule and a change in the price as we see from here to here cut the change in price will not cause this curve to change or shift the change in price simply causes us to move along a given demand curve now you may be thinking but I always heard that if the price goes up people buy less yes that's true but that is not what we mean by demand demand is the entire crew were scheduled we have another term for the amount the specific amount the buyers wish to purchase and that term is quantity demanded the quantity demanded is the specific amount that consumers wish to buy it is what we're measuring along the horizontal axis so how do we change quantity demanded for a given demand curve for the answer is if you increase the price quantity demand will fall if you lower the price quantity demand will rise by the way this idea this is simply a restatement of the law of demand that says that there is an inverse relationship between the price and the quantity that buyers wish to purchase
