Confidence may be the most influential second dimension contributor to success. Confidence is defined as an individual’s belief that he or she has the necessary skills to produce a desired outcome.1 In other words, the athlete has the ability to do the task at hand as related to first dimension, but now has lost the ability to do so. Notice the definition has two keywords; skill and belief. I like to reduce the definition of confidence to this; ‘a belief in a skill set’. Notice these deal with two dimensions. First dimension… skill. As any good coach you must always continue working on developing and reaffirming skill. That is why first dimension is listed as… first dimension. The second key word is ‘belief’. You must have a strategy to help the athlete ‘believe’. The majority of coaches want to re-establish confidence only by working in the first dimension. You must have a strategy to also work in the second dimension. Have you ever tried to define the term ‘belief’? Tough, isn’t it?  See, we have to get rid of clichés like you need to ‘believe in yourself’, ‘you need to believe in your ability’. What does that mean? Were good at throwing terms or phrases around but most athletes and their parents have a misconstrued idea of what it means. Let’s quit using phrases like ‘you need to regain confidence’…’ come on and get motivated’. Let’s quit being a ‘fan’ of the second dimension. Instead, Lets be a ‘coach’ of the second dimension.
