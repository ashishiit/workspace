If outcome goals are hollow by themselves, we then look at components within the outcome goals to measure. These are called performance goals. Performance goals are defined as an athlete’s actual performance in relation to their own standards of excellence. Let’s take basketball for example. You tell your team this: “If we shoot 75% from the free throw line and 50% from the 3 point arc & out-rebound… we will win the game.” Outcome goal: win the game. Performance goals: 75%, 50%, and be in the plus column in rebounds. So what is the issue? There’s no coaching going on. You either see if you accomplish these numbers or not. The only thing performance goals can do is tell you what you might need to work on a practice. They have some value, but to be honest, even a fan can tell you what you need to work on based on these numbers. So what is real coaching?
