Our next task is to understand our role as a coach. What could the role of the coach be if we embrace a 3Dimensional approach?  If you could give me a definition of a coach, what would you say?  In fact we are going to take a moment now to come up with your answer.  Later in this journey you will be given tools and a process for writing what we call a Transformational Purpose statement for your coaching.  This might be a start that you will refer back to. 

One word answers are most typically a motivator, a teacher.  I like this famous American coach, Tom Landry’s definition:  A coach is somebody who gets people to do what they don't want to do, in order to attain that which they do want to attain. That's pretty good isn't it? To get them to do what they don't want to do is "effort.”  To attain that which they do want to attain, That’s "imagination.”  Our imagination and our effort.  What am I pursuing and persisting after? That is a really good definition. But I think there is an even better definition. In fact it is the very first definition ever created. From the 1500's: a coach is a covered carriage that takes a person of importance from where they are to where they want to or need to go. Isn't that a great definition of what you do?! You take people of importance, you take our kids. Our treasure. And you take them from where they are to where they want to or need to go.  Notice also, it’s a covered carriage.  You provide protection on the journey.  (1:30) When athletes feel protected, safe, they are much freer to take risks, to make mistakes.  No real learning can happen without risk, without mistakes.
