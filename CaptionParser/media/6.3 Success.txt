Here is what happens when an athlete begins to exhibit internal and external attribution. It leads to a concept called global attribution. The athlete believes (there it is again the key word…belief) their success will generalize to all areas of their lives.3 Just by how you coach in developing a confident mindset, an athlete begins to think they can do well in their math class or whatever other area they may be struggling. Think about that. As you become a coach that looks for and re-establishes past successes, looks around and sees other succeeding and give specific verbal encouragement, just by coaching your sport, athletes begin to think they can do other things in their life well. This is when the phrase, “believe in yourself” has some credence. It’s not so much believing in yourself but believing when you do other things well on the sports field, it carries over into other areas of your life. Do you know what we call that? Influence. You are now a significant person of influence. It is said that in today’s culture, the majority of people do not like what they do at work as it does not seem to give them a sense of purpose. Coaches, we have that…purpose and influence… and it is right here at our doorstep. Because of the significant impact of sport on our culture, and coaches are the only ones that can control what sport teaches, you have the greatest potential for influence… Purpose. This was all brought back to me as a 40-year-old of why I loved coaching as a 22-year-old, but now I could define it in understand it. Yes!
