Why do you want to work for Vote.org? *
I am intrigued by the mission statement of Vote.org which is
the use of technology to simplify political engagement thereby
increasing voter turnout. I am personally very passionate about
using technology to simplify complex problems people face. I feel that
the citizens want to vote but there may be some inconvenience or
complications involved which demotivate them to vote. If technology
can help to remove or reduce this barrier then I would be very happy
to help using my skill and experience.

Tell us how this role fits in to your career trajectory. *
I have previous work experience working as Software Test Engineer.
I want to improve to a Software Engineering position through this role.
After some time I would think to improve to a Product Manager role and grow within the same company.

What makes you a great fit for this job? *
I think I have the potential to deliver quality work
because I have experience with some of the required skill set.
I have the basic understanding of those skills and can hone it further
to gain mastery.

Tell us about a project that you've taken from idea to production. *
I thought of creating a blogging service. Anyone can use it to create one's own blog.
The user can add a title, add some text and add a picture to the blog. Other users can
comment on that blog as well.
Here is the GitHub link to the project https://github.com/ashishiit/ashish-blog
The project is live at https://projectashish.herokuapp.com/

Tell us about a time where you were involved with a major issue/outage and how you responded *
I used to write automation scripts for the entire regression test cases for Android mobile devices
at Motorola Mobility, Chicago. Once there was a major update to the software with critical fixes and the upper management
wanted to see the test results next day itself. Since there were major updates, I worked late night
after business work hours to update the test code. Thus I was able to run the automation overnight
and have the results the next day early morning.

It's your first day on the job. Based on your understanding of the position, challenges, and opportunities, what are the first questions you would ask and why? *
1. what is the objective of the position in greater detail because I need to have a clear understanding of the problem and I can think accordingly to provide a solution.
2. Is there any existing issue so that I can figure out what is preventing the product to be 100% efficient.
3. Can we add some new features to the product so that it can help to reach more customers.

Which of the "bonus skills" will you bring to Vote.org? *
Experience working remotely
Experience working on a small team
Experience with GitHub, forking, and issue tracking.
Experience building accessible software and testing for accessibility

## first question

def flatten_list(nested_list):
  """
  Flatten a arbitrarily nested list
  Args:
    nested_list: a nested list with item to be either integer or list
    example:
      [2,[[3,[4]], 5]]
  Returns:
    a flattened list with only integers
    example:
      [2,3,4,5]
  """

## Second question:
## you need to define the tree/node object and also define the function to serialize the tree

    class Node:
      pass
    
    def serialize_tree(tree):
      """
      Serialize a tree from top to bottom, left to right to a list of values
      Args: 
        a Tree object, each node has an integer value, and optionally have a left and right children, The tree is not ordered or balanced, it's just a binary tree
        example:
            1
           / \
          2   3
         / \ / \
           4 2
      Returns: 
        a list of serialized values
        example: [1,2,3,None,4,2,None]
		
		
############################
1. Write a function that takes two parameters as input:
* string_list, a list of strings
* n, a positive integer
and returns a list of each string that appears exactly n times in string_list 
and each string should appear exactly once in the result.
example: 
* string_list = ['red', 'red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'blue']
* n = 2
* returns: ['red', 'blue']
NOTE: You will be testing this function for the next question.

################################################################
3. Write a function `is_balanced` that takes 1 parameter as input:
* parens, a string containing only the characters '(' and ')'
and returns a boolean indicating whether the parentheses are "balanced" (in the typical sense in math/programming). Some examples:
* "()()()()" is balanced
* ")()()()(" is NOT balanced
* "((())())" is balanced
* "(((((())" is NOT balanced
NOTE: You will be testing this function for the next question.
