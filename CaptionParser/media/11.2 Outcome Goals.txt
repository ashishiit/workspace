First, we must define what goal setting is; refers to attaining a specific level of proficiency on a task, usually in a specified time limit… Task-time limit! In a performance based culture of sport, goals seem to be everywhere. Here is a question. Do they help or hurt performance? It depends. There are three types of goals; outcome goals, performance goals and process goals. Let’s go through each. First, outcome goals. It is simply defined as a desired result of competition. “Win the game,” “be district champion,” “make the playoffs.” You have many coaches that set these as goals and leave it there. That is not coaching. Every coach wants to win the game, make the playoffs, and be a champion. Again, we become fans. Why? Because at the end of the game, playoff or final, you either won or did not win. And let’s be real, only one wins. Let’s continue.
