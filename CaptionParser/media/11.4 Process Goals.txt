Process goals: process goals are concerned with how athletes perform particular skills or execute strategies in the moment. Let’s take the performance goal of shooting the “three.” If you see one of your athletes with a flaw in their shooting motion you respond with immediate concern and fixation. “Jimmy, you have to square up on your jump shot. Your falling away. Square up and follow through.” This can be done during a timeout, in transition or maybe even at halftime but it is in real time. Whether you shoot 50% or not from the arc has no relevance to the game at hand. Great coaches are about process. Yes, use performance goals to measure what you need to work on, and quit even discussing outcome goals. Performance goals and outcome goals just happen. Process goals are coached.
