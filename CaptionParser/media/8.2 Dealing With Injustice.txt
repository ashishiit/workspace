This is a very common question for coaches when discussing the emotional matrix. When is it OK to be angry? The answer is simple but profound. When there is social injustice affecting the team… it might be time for short-term anger. What is social injustice? When someone hurts the team by their selfish action such as degrading another player based on ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It could be for lying to the coaches about grade point averages or skipping class that causes an eligibility issue. All of these are social injustices and the use of short-term anger is helpful in these regards: 1. Triggers motivation to clear obstacles, 2. It can increase effort to do right, 3. Elevates intensity (if needed) 4. Can distract (for a short-term ) from the pain. Now, here’s the catch. It has to be short term. Make the point known… and then get back to teaching and coaching. Sometimes we refer to this as ‘lighting a fire’ for a good cause… for social justice…. not poor performance. I had the opportunity to be around Coach Bowden in some very intense situations. In all my years I only saw him get angry and cuss three times. In fact, the first time I heard him yell “damn it” at practice, I thought the world was going to stop! Some players had been caught missing class and didn’t tell anyone until their poor grades were revealed, harming their eligibility thus harming the team with these selfish and lying actions. That really bothered Coach, that players would be that selfish and not admit to the selfishness until they were caught. I remember the anger lasted about 2 minutes and then we were right back to practice. Short-term anger must be used seldom, selective, and to pinpoint social injustice in and around the team.
