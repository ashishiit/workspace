As with most strategies of second dimension it just gets better. You begin now to see that coaching in the 2nd dimension is bringing the beauty and the wellness of sport back to the forefront. Once global attribution is beginning to be obtained it leads to stable attribution. Stable attribution; optimistic athletes foster confidence in their ability and efforts by believing (there it is again) that their successes in the present will continue to ensure success in the future. Coaches, just by how you coach a confident mindset athletes think they can do well in the future. You know what you have just created? Legacy! Global attribution creates influence, stable attribution creates a legacy. I love what Christa McAuliffe, the former teacher/astronaut that died in the Challenger shuttle accident said about her role as a teacher… “I touch the future, I teach.” The year was 1986. A full generation later with sport now becoming the largest discretionary activity we do as a culture I believe we can say, “I touch the future, I coach.” What if someone came up to you as you are beginning to think about your career aspirations and said, “how would you like to do something that you loved playing growing up, that gives you a great purpose into the lives of others, and creates a legacy into the future and maybe even eternally?” Well, guess what? Coaching done well, in helping to create the confident mindset, does exactly that. Here’s the reality check. Every training and competitive experience offers information that can either build or harms an athlete’s confidence. And this is taught by the coach, Lets be builders.
